# RGB-Color-Game

This is a simple RGB Color Game I coded along watching Colt Steele's course ''The Web Developer Bootcamp'' on Udemy.
For some spice of my own I made the design a bit different so as to not be an exact copy of Colt's work.

### Features
* Easy mode - 3 colors
* Difficult mode - 6 colors
* User can generate new colors / start new game
* Game indicates if the picked color was right or wrong
